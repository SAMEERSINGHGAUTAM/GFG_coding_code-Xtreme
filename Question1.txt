-> Number of 1 bits:

Given a positive integer N, print the count of set bits in it.
Example-1
  Input N = 6
  Output : 2
Explanation: 
Binary representation is '110' 
So the count of the set bit is 2.

Example-2
  Input N = 8
  Output : 1
Explanation:
Binary representation is '1000'
So the count of the set bit is 1.

Your task : You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function setBits() which takes an integer N and returns the count of the number of set bits.

Expected Time complexity : O(log n)
Expexted Auxiliary Space : O(1)

Constraints : 1 <= N <= 109
